# General

## Introduction

Elasticsearch is:-

* A distributed search and analytics engine
* Scalable data store, and vector database built on Apache Lucene
* Optimized for speed and relevance on production-scale workloads.
* To search, index, store, and analyze data of all shapes and sizes in near real time.

Is the heart of the Elastic Stack. Combined with Kibana, it powers:-

* Observability
* Search
* Security

## Use cases

### Observability

* Logs, metrics, and traces: Collect, store, and analyze logs, metrics, and traces from applications, systems, and services.
* Application performance monitoring (APM): Monitor and analyze the performance of business-critical software applications.
* Real user monitoring (RUM): Monitor, quantify, and analyze user interactions with web applications.
* OpenTelemetry: Reuse your existing instrumentation to send telemetry data to the Elastic Stack using the OpenTelemetry standard.

### Search

* **Full-text search**: Build a fast, relevant full-text search solution using inverted indexes, tokenization, and text analysis.
* **Vector database**: Store and search vectorized data, and create vector embeddings with built-in and third-party natural language processing (NLP) models.
* **Semantic search**: Understand the intent and contextual meaning behind search queries using tools like synonyms, dense vector embeddings, and learned sparse query-document expansion.
* **Hybrid search**: Combine full-text search with vector search using state-of-the-art ranking algorithms.
* **Build search experiences**: Add hybrid search capabilities to apps or websites, or build enterprise search engines over your organizationâ€™s internal data sources.
* **Retrieval augmented generation (RAG)**: Use Elasticsearch as a retrieval engine to supplement generative AI models with more relevant, up-to-date, or proprietary data for a range of use cases.
Geospatial search: Search for locations and calculate spatial relationships using geospatial queries.

### Security

* **Security information and event management (SIEM)**: Collect, store, and analyze security data from applications, systems, and services.
* **Endpoint security**: Monitor and analyze endpoint security data.
Threat hunting: Search and analyze data to detect and respond to security threats.
